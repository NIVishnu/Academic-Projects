Summary:

The primary objective of this study was to design and implement a relational database 
system to ease the process of Rental Management. It helps to track the profit margin 
using revenue generated and customers to find the apartments based on budget 
preferences. It also helps to track the maintenance requests for the apartments to find out 
which apartment required more maintenance.
The database was designed with the data fields that customers and landlords need. The 
conceptual model was mapped to a relational model with the necessary primary and 
foreign keys after the EER and UML diagrams were modelled. This database was then 
implemented in MySQL and implemented in MongoDB NoSQL database to study the 
feasibility of this database in a NoSQL environment.
The created database is connected to R and visualization of analyzed data helps landlord, 
customer, and our firm to improve the standards of Rental Management System. This 
also helps us to predict and manage the resources needed to customers without delays.
