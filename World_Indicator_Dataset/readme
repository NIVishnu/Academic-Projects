Summary:

### 1. Clustering Methods:
- **K-means Clustering:**
  - Applied the K-means algorithm to group countries based on selected attributes.
  - Determined the optimal number of clusters (K) using methods like the Elbow method or Silhouette score.

- **Hierarchical Clustering:**
  - Employed hierarchical clustering to group countries based on similarity.
  - Used linkage methods (e.g., Ward, Complete, Average) and a dendrogram to visualize cluster structures.

### 2. Internal Validation Metrics:
- Utilized internal validation metrics such as Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or Inertia for K-means to assess the quality of the clusters.
- Employed metrics like Cophenetic correlation coefficient for hierarchical clustering.

### 3. Best Clustering Solution:
- Determined the best clustering solution based on a combination of internal validation metrics and the interpretability of the clusters.
- Considered both methods' results to ensure robustness.

### 4. Cluster Details:
- Provided a detailed list of all the groups formed by each method and the countries included within each group.
- Described the characteristics of each cluster to offer insights into the similarities among countries.

### 5. Scatter Plots:
- Generated three scatter plots, such as "Life Expectancy vs GDP," "Infant Mortality vs GDP," and another of your choice.
- Colored the data points according to the identified clusters to visually represent the grouping.

### 6. Interpretation and Conclusion:
- Interpreted the results, highlighting the key findings and patterns within the clusters.
- Concluded by summarizing the overall effectiveness of the clustering methods and their relevance to the selected attributes.

This summary provides an overview of the steps taken, metrics used, and the final outcomes in terms of clustering solutions and visualizations.
